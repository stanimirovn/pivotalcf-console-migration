 Under **Configure support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header**, configure <%= vars.product_name %> to handle `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP headers based on where TLS is terminated for the first time in your deployment. 
    <%= image_tag 'networking_xforwarded-client-cert-xfcc.png' %>
     The following table indicates which option to choose based on your deployment layout. 
    <table class="nice">
    <tr>
      <th>If your deployment is configured as follows:</th>
      <th>Then select the following option:</th>
      <th>Additional notes:</th>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
      <td><ul><li>Load balancer is terminating TLS, and 
      <li>Load balancer is configured to put the client certificate from a mutual authentication TLS handshake into the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert HTTP header

      </td>
       <td>TLS terminated for the first time at infrastructure load balancer (default).

      <li>HAProxy instance count is > 0

      </ul>
      </td>
      <td>TLS terminated for the first time at HAProxy.</td>
      <td>HAProxy sets the XFCC header with the client certificate received in the TLS handshake. Gorouter forwards the header.</td>

       <td>TLS terminated for the first time at the Router.
      </td>
      <td>
        Gorouter strips the XFCC header if it is included in the request and forwards the client certificate received in the TLS handshake in a new XFCC header. <br/><br/>
        If you have deployed instances of HAProxy, app traffic bypasses those instances in this configuration. If you have also configured your load balancer to route requests for ssh directly to the Diego Brain, consider reducing HAProxy instances to 0.
