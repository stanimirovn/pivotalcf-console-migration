This topic explains how to view and manage orgs and spaces in Apps Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To manage a space, you must have Space Manager permissions in that space.</p>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

You can use Apps Manager to manage orgs and spaces. This includes creating and deleting orgs,
domains, and spaces, managing member permissions, adding metadata, and more.

For information about managing apps and service instances, see
[Managing Apps and Service Instances Using Apps Manager](manage-apps.html).


<!-- This ensures that the paragraph below only appears in the PCF docs, not in the PWS docs.  -->

You can manage orgs and spaces across multiple foundations. For more information, see
[Configuring Multi-Foundation Support in Apps Manager](../opsguide/configure-multi-foundation.html).



## <a id='prerequisite'></a> Prerequisite

To do the following, you must first log in to Apps Manager with an account that has adequate
permissions.

For more information, see [About Permissions](dev-console.html#permissions) in

You can manage org resources, including the spaces, domains, and members associated with the
selected space, in Apps Manager. You can also manage org settings.
